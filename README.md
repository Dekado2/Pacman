# Pacman
Modified Pacman game with additions (Fifth Project) such as: optional local player vs player mode - each player gets 40 seconds to play
before it goes over to the other player's turn, after which the player resumes playing from the last point his game paused on.
The player with the most points accumulated after both players lose all their life points - wins.
Upon eating all the candies (besides the poison candy) the player continues to the next level.
The map is different from the official pacman game, the ghost sprites are different and so are their movement decision.
A normal candy awards 1 point while a silver candy (bigger variation) awards 50 points. Eating a poison candy (green candy) causes an
instant lose of life point while eating a question candy causes a question to appear and extra ghosts spawn which represent the answers
to the question. The player must eat the ghost which represents the correct answer to the question to earn extra points - eating the wrong ghosts or colliding with a normal ghosts causes the player to lose a life point. Lastly there is one shiny candy per level which appears at the beginning and lasts 15 seconds before disappearing - eating this candy will multiply the current player's points by 2!
In the menus there is an option to view leaderboards - top 10 players, edit, remove and add questions (2-4 possible answers to a question)
and other various options (map scaling, game speed and sound control).

In the menus music is played as well as fog and a shining title animations!
